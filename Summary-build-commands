You can substitute /mnt/external/for some other dir. I used /mnt/external because I had an external drive since it takes 100GB or so for a complete build.  

sudo mkdir /mnt/external/lineage
cd /mnt/external/lineage
sudo repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b lineage-17.1
sudo repo sync
cd /mnt/external/lineage/.repo
sudo mkdir local_manifests
sudo nano roomservice.xml --//copy contents of roomservice.xml into this new file OR cp roomservice.xml  /mnt/external/.repo/local_manifests
sudo chown -R username.username /mnt/external/
source build/envsetup.sh
repo sync
lunch ( In my case it's 12. lineage_ktouch_I9-userdebug so choose 12, otherwise choose corresponding number )
breakfast ( In my case it's 12. lineage_ktouch_I9-userdebug so choose 12, otherwise choose corresponding number )
